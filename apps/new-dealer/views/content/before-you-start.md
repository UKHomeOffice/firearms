You must provide evidence to justify the types and quantities of prohibited items requested, and show how theyâ€™ll be obtained and used.

You will be asked to upload this evidence later in the form, as well as any existing authority document you have. You cannot save your answers so it may be helpful to get these things ready before you start. 

Your evidence could include:

* current or future contracts
* invoices from the past 6 months
* letters of sponsorship from the past 6 months
* a valid import licence
* details of third-party storage
